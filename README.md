## <div align="center">About Me<div>

ðŸ‘‹ Hello there! I'm Yolis, a junior software developer with a passion for coding and a strong focus on JavaScript. I have hands-on experience working on projects using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js), which has allowed me to develop full-stack web applications efficiently.

ðŸš€ I'm constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills in the tech field. I enjoy exploring different programming concepts, experimenting with innovative solutions, and staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends.

ðŸŒ± Whether it's diving deeper into JavaScript frameworks, exploring new technologies, or collaborating on exciting projects, I'm always ready to take on new challenges and contribute my expertise to meaningful software development endeavors.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me via yolisisabel@gmail.com or connect with me on www.linkedin.com/in/yolisma-zacarias4

Let's code and create something amazing together! ðŸ’»
